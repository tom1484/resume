# PLAN.md — Job Pipeline Progress Tracker

Plan of record: [PROPOSALS.md](PROPOSALS.md) · Setup checklist:
[PREPARE.md](PREPARE.md)

**Rule:** statuses here are updated in the same commit as the work they
describe. A task is checked only when its verification column passed.

Legend: `[ ]` pending · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` done (verified)

## Phase overview

| Phase | Scope (details in PROPOSALS.md §8) | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Workspace split, overlay contract, master bank draft, compose skeleton | done |
| 2 | Discovery (JobSpy + boards) + scoring + calibration | done (threshold calibration pending labels) |
| 3 | Tailoring + verify + review app + notifier | done (review UI live behind auth at jobs.churong.cc) |
| 4 | Apply agent (local machine, HITL) | **next** |
| 5 | Hardening: eval harness in CI, stats, cost guardrails | pending |

## Phase 1 tasks

Checkpoint: a hand-written overlay renders as a tailored resume at
`https://jobs.churong.cc/?application=test`.

| # | Task | Verification | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| T0 | PLAN.md tracker | committed | [x] |
| T1 | Render baseline (pre-split) | all profiles captured to `.render-baseline/` | [x] |
| T2 | Workspace split: `apps/site` + `packages/renderer`, root scripts delegate | `pnpm validate/test/build/pdf` green from root; **DOM diff vs baseline empty** for every profile (PNG pixel-identical too) | [x] |
| T3 | `overlay.schema.json` + validate.mjs covers `applications/*/overlay.json` incl. patch dry-run | valid/invalid fixtures behave as expected in vitest; `pnpm validate` green | [x] |
| T4 | Overlay engine (`applyOverlay`), `buildProfileFrom` refactor, async bootstrap `?application=<id>`, visible error on failure, `test` fixture | identity property test; capture `application=test` shows patched content + excluded sections absent; plain profiles still match baseline; missing overlay → error box, zero resume content | [x] |
| T5 | `master.json` bullet bank: schema + initial draft (stable ids) | `pnpm validate` green; id-uniqueness + source-pointer-resolution + highlight-coverage tests | [x] |
| T6 | CI workflow: no YAML changes needed (workflow only calls root pnpm scripts; script paths updated in T2) | push → CI green (GitHub API check) | [x] |
| T7 | `deploy/docker-compose.yml`: `db` (pgvector) + `review` (nginx static stub) on `nginx` network; deploy | compose healthy; `http://review:8080` + overlay JSON served from inside `nginx` network; **checkpoint verified: `https://jobs.churong.cc/?application=test` renders patched highlight, filtered sections** | [x] |
| T8 | Close out: PLAN/CLAUDE/PREPARE/memory updated | final push, CI green | [x] |

Post-checkpoint (Tom): request Let's Encrypt cert + enable NPM access list
(PREPARE.md item 3).

## Phase 2 tasks

Checkpoint: discovery runs nightly, new jobs land scored in Postgres, and a
Telegram summary arrives with the top matches.

Design note (deviation from PROPOSALS §5): pgvector bullet retrieval is
**deferred** — the master bank (~40 bullets) fits whole in any prompt, so
RAG retrieval adds latency without value at this scale, and embeddings
would require a second LLM vendor (Anthropic has no embeddings API).
Scoring = 0.5·keyword (code, fuzzy) + 0.3·LLM fit (Haiku) + 0.2·structural.
Revisit when the bank grows ~10×.

| # | Task | Verification | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| P2.1 | DB migrations (`jobs`, `events`) + runner in pipeline service | migrations apply idempotently against the live db container | [x] |
| P2.2 | Discovery service (Python/uv): Greenhouse/Lever/Ashby board fetchers, normalize → dedupe → upsert; config from PREPARE.md drafts (slugs live-verified, 10 boards) | live smoke: 8 real internships inserted; rerun 0 dupes; 10 pytest cases incl. the Internal≠Intern and year≠EAR word-boundary regressions | [x] |
| P2.3 | JobSpy searches (from searches.yml), conservative throttling, exclude-keyword skip marking | live smoke with one query; excluded titles marked `skipped` with reason | [x] |
| P2.4 | Pipeline service (Node ESM): `parse-jd` (Haiku structured) + scoring + poller + events logging | 16 unit tests (incl. AWS≠CSS fuzzy regression); 30 real JDs parsed+scored live at ~1.1¢/job | [x] |
| P2.5 | Telegram batch summary | delivered live (events: notify ok) + format unit tests | [x] |
| P2.6 | Compose: discovery (supercronic nightly, `init: true` — PID-1 fatal fixed) + pipeline poller; review healthcheck fixed (busybox wget → 127.0.0.1) | end-to-end live: discovery --all → 23 inserted → poller drained queue → 30 scored → Telegram | [x] |
| P2.7 | Golden JD evals (6 frozen real JDs, live recall assertion — gates prompt changes per CLAUDE.md) + calibration CSV exported & sent to Tom | parse eval 6/6 recall=1.0; threshold recommender unit-tested; **SCORE_THRESHOLD update pending Tom's labels (not blocking)** | [x] |
| P2.8 | CI: discovery job (uv + ruff + pytest); pipeline tests already in root vitest | CI green | [x] |

## Phase 3 tasks

Checkpoint: approve a tailored application entirely from a phone —
tailored resume + diff + cover letter reviewed at jobs.churong.cc,
approve flips status, artifacts (PDF) ready for the apply agent.

| # | Task | Verification | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| P3.1 | Tailor stage: overlay generation (Sonnet default, Opus for `dream` flag), grounded on master bank with per-patch `groundedIn` citations | 3 real jobs tailored live (2-4¢/job): overlays mechanically valid, patches cite bullets; Wayve over-reach correctly blocked by verify | [x] |
| P3.2 | Verify-claims: deterministic numeric tripwire + Haiku skeptic; `audit.unsupported` must be `[]` | **adversarial eval 4/4 (3 runs each)**: invented metric (tripwire), leadership, technology all flagged 3/3; clean rephrase 0/3 | [x] |
| P3.3 | Per-application artifacts: overlay stored on job row (migration 002), served from DB via API at `/applications/:id/overlay.json`; drop-unsupported-patches policy | 2 real jobs tailored→verified→in_review (1 & 3 patches dropped); overlay served, renders tailored bullets via embedded `/site/?application=` | [x] |
| P3.4 | Review API (Fastify `services/api`) + review SPA (`apps/review`, iframes `/site/?application=` for the resume pane): /inbox tabs, /app/:id three-pane, approve/reject/label/good-bad. Internal-only until P3.7 auth | live over internal net: inbox/detail/overlay/approve(→409 on re-approve)/label all correct; embedded tailored resume renders; calibration label persists | [x] |
| P3.5 | Pipeline cycle: scored ≥ gate auto-tailors → verifies → in_review; Telegram links each to its review page | live (temp gate 0.5): 2 jobs new→scored→tailored→in_review, verify dropped over-reach, notify fired with links. NOTE: real 0.65 gate currently tailors nothing (top score 0.63) until calibration | [x] |
| P3.6 | Answers bank: seed (migration 003: F-1/CPT, citizenship, availability + TODO placeholders) + `/answers` editor in review UI; `GET /api/answers` for the apply agent | seeded 6 answers; PUT edit round-trips live; UI renders 6 editable fields | [x] |
| P3.7 | Review app live behind NPM access list at `https://jobs.churong.cc` (jobs-api:8080); Cloudflare SSL→Full fixed the redirect loop | ✓ auth prompt → review inbox loads; checkpoint met | [x] |

## Review UI enhancements (post-Phase-3)

| # | Task | Verification | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | Overlay model: per-section `exclude` (hide items) + `order` (reorder), by title | renderer applyFilter + schema; 7 tests | [x] |
| R2 | `editorModel.js`: overlay ⇄ section/item/bullet tree (with paths); bullet edits = whole-array replace | round-trip tests (hide item, edit/hide bullet, reorder) | [x] |
| R3 | API: PUT /overlay validates schema + patch dry-run (data dir mounted); GET /api/resume | invalid (no personalInfo / bad path) → 400 live | [x] |
| R4 | Structured editor + JSON tab in review Detail (toggle/reorder/inline-edit, live re-render) | builds; 66 tests pass | [x] |
| R5 | Deploy + live verify | E2E on jobs.churong.cc: edit bullet → save → persists & re-renders | [x] |
| R6 | LLM tailoring chat (proposes overlay ops, accept/reject, reuses verify) | — | deferred (by decision) |

## Editor overhaul (post-Phase-3, "intuitive editing")

Decisions (confirmed): DB is the single source of truth for the canonical
résumé (seeded from resume.json) + version history + git-export; profiles
removed (no `?profile`, single `/resume` route); reorder via @dnd-kit
(touch+mouse); renderer editor = reorder + rephrase + delete (trash) +
column-ratio + JSON tab, NO visibility toggles (hiding is overlay-only);
overlay editor keeps include/exclude + hide, moves to a modal; application
render is read-only (no editor toggle). Reverses the "resume.json never
mutated" invariant — the file becomes seed + export target.

| # | Task | Verification | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| E1 | DB resume store: `resume_versions` table + API (GET current, PUT=snapshot+set-current, history list, restore, export) | seed-on-empty; PUT validates + creates history; restore works (curl) | [ ] |
| E2 | Renderer: rip out Ctrl+D panel/configContext/import-export/profiles/`?profile`; fold column-ratio into resume `meta.layout`; base-résumé fetch with bundled fallback; `/resume` (editable) + `?application` (read-only) routes | render baseline (old `full`) == `/resume` DOM; `?application` still renders; build/pdf green | [ ] |
| E3 | Shared `<ResumeTreeEditor>` (dnd-kit drag, inline rephrase) + two adapters: resume (delete, column-ratio) and overlay (include/exclude, hide) | unit tests for both serializations | [ ] |
| E4 | `/resume` editor wired to PUT /api/resume (history snapshot per save); JSON tab; live re-render | live: edit → save → persists + re-renders; history row added | [ ] |
| E5 | Overlay editor → modal in review; no editor toggle on the application render pane | live: modal edits save; application iframe read-only | [ ] |
| E6 | Pipeline reads current résumé from DB (file fallback) so tailoring uses edits | tailor a job after an edit; reflects the edit | [ ] |
| E7 | PDF/capture/CI + render-check skill de-profiled (single résumé) | `pnpm pdf` → one PDF; CI green | [ ] |
| E8 | Deploy + live verify + docs (CLAUDE invariant, ARCHITECTURE, memory) | end-to-end on jobs.churong.cc | [ ] |
